# About: YouTube Summarizer

This project is a simple command-line tool designed to make YouTube content more accessible and digestible.

## What it Does

1.  **Fetches Transcripts:** Takes a YouTube video URL and extracts its full text transcript.
2.  **Generates Summaries:** Uses the power of Google's Gemini AI to create a concise summary of the video's content.
3.  **Identifies Key Terms:** Pulls out important or less-known concepts from the video and provides brief explanations.
4.  **Translates:** Translates the summary and key terms into Telugu for wider accessibility.

## Purpose

The goal is to help users quickly understand the core ideas of a video without needing to watch it in its entirety, which is especially useful for long lectures, tutorials, or presentations.
