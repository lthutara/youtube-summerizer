# Project TODO List

## Future Enhancements:

- [ ] **Handle non-English videos:** Implement logic to detect the language of the video and provide summaries/translations accordingly. This might involve using language detection libraries or leveraging the Gemini API's language capabilities.
- [ ] **Generate comprehensive article from core topics:** Expand the identified core topics into a more detailed and cohesive article, potentially by extracting more information from the transcript or using the LLM for further elaboration.
- [ ] **Utilize video chapters for structured summarization:** If available, detect and use video chapters to segment the transcript and generate chapter-specific summaries. Fallback to current chunking if chapters are not present.
